# Project 06: Long-Horizon Planning Agent

## Core Question
**How does an agent pursue a goal across time without losing direction?**

---

## Problem

Most agents operate in short, isolated episodes.

They can:
- reason correctly
- plan individual tasks
- select strategies
- adapt after failures

Yet they still fail at **long-term autonomy**.

They:
- lose sight of the original goal
- replan too often or not at all
- fail to detect drift
- persist with failing objectives indefinitely

Humans don’t work this way.

We:
- commit to long-term goals
- periodically check progress
- notice when we are off track
- adapt strategy or abandon goals when necessary

This project gives agents those capabilities.
